  firstCombatStartLines:
  - text: Welcome to the combat screen! This is where you'll do battle with all sorts
      of nefarious baddies.
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: In the upper left corner you have your own health, and in the upper right
      you have your enemy's. The first to get their opponent to zero health wins!
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: The primary way you'll damage your opponent is by creating projectiles.
      After closing this dialogue, choose the bolt spell from your spell list on
      the left side of the screen. Oh, and if you want me to repeat what I've said,
      click the "replay dialogue" button.
    panelIndex: 1
  firstCombatSelectSpell:
  - text: Now that you have your spell selected, you need to cast it along a path
      - a path being one of those five blob-shaped things in the middle of the screen.
      After closing this dialogue, choose one of the paths to cast your bolt spell.
    panelIndex: 0
  firstCombatSelectPath:
  - text: Notice how the projectile is still hovering in mid-air. Projectiles take
      a turn or two to reach their opponent and will land right after their target
      has a chance to cast their own spells.
    panelIndex: 0
  - text: So, when a spell is hurtling towards you, you'll have a chance to cast
      a shield spell to block it - but more on that later.
    panelIndex: 0
  - text: You can cast as many spells as you have mana for during your turn. Why
      don't you cast a couple more bolt spells for good measure?
    panelIndex: 0
  firstCombatCastThirdSpell:
  - text: Huzzah! I knew I could count on my - that is, your - natural aptitude.
      Now, after closing this dialogue, click the "end turn" button and watch those
      spells fly!
    panelIndex: 1
  firstCombatStartSecondPlayerTurn:
  - text: Whizz! Pow! Look at those spells land! I never thought I'd have a chance
      to witness my prowess from third person.
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: I think you understand the basics. I'm going to contemplate my new turnip
      existence while you finish off this battle.

  secondCombatStartLines:
  - text: This one might be tricky. If you check the "enemy detail" panel, you can
      see this demon has the ability to heal - in fact, it's strong enough to be
      able to heal itself to full each round!
    panelIndex: 0
  - text: Here's where paths can work to your advantage. Projectiles along the middle
      three paths will take one turn to reach their opponents, while projectiles
      along the highest and lowest will take two.
    panelIndex: 0
  - text: Try firing bolt spells along the highest and lowest paths, and then, the
      next turn, firing them along the middle paths. You'll do enough damage to be
      able to knock out the enemy all at once!

  createFirstSpell:
  - text: Aah, the Spellforge! Making spells has always been a favorite pastime of
      mine, even if it does pollute the air with rune dust that slowly liquefies
      your lungs. That's why we have healing spells!
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: On the left you'll see all of the runes in your inventory. On the right
      you have the scroll that represents the spell you're about to create.
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: Right now, we only have access to one scroll type - the humble slug, with
      only three rune slots. We'll get more as we make progress that allow us to
      make more exotic spells.
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: In the center here there's a little preview of the spell you're about to
      create.
    panelIndex: 0
  - text: That demon we defeated left us with some of the basic types of rune. A
      shield rune is a primary rune, so we can only have one in a spell. It'll cause
      our spell to create a shield when it's cast.
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: We can use enhancement runes to make the effects of primary and secondary
      runes stronger. These enhance the strength of connected runes, the connections
      being those yellow lines between rune slots.
    panelIndex: 1
  - text: Trying creating a shield spell. After closing this dialogue, drag the shield
      rune into the middle and the enhancement runes onto either side, then press
      "Create Spell".
    panelIndex: 1
  didntUseAllRunes:
  - text: Hold on! We want this spell to be as strong as it can be, so let's use
      all of the runes. Drag them over from your inventory on the left to the scroll
      on the right.
    panelIndex: 1
  wrongRuneArrangement:
  - text: Hold on! We want this spell to be as strong as it can be, so we have to
      make sure the runes are positioned correclty. The shield rune should be in
      the middle while the strengthen adjacent runes should be in the top and bottom.
    panelIndex: 1
  finishedFirstSpell:
  - text: Great! Let's head back to the map. Press the "Return" button in the upper
      left corner after closing this dialogue.
    panelIndex: 1
  thirdCombatStartLines:
  - text: Wow! This guy looks like packs a punch. We'll need that shield spell...
      but it only lasts one turn, so you should wait until the demon's projectile's
      in the air to use it.
    panelIndex: 1
  thirdCombatStartSecondPlayerTurn:
  - text: Alright, now! Cast the shield spell along the path of the enemy's projectile,
      or you're toast!
